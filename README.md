## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

Note: On Windows, winsound is built-in.

## How It Works
1. Voice Recognition
Uses speech_recognition and the Google API to transcribe spoken words into text.

2. Morse Code Mapping
Uses a dictionary to map letters and numbers to Morse code and vice versa.

3. Text to Speech
Uses pyttsx3 to convert text into spoken output.

4. Morse Code Beeps
Uses winsound.Beep to emit high-pitched short and long beeps for dots (.) and dashes (-).

## Future Enhancements

Add support for multiple languages
Create a GUI with Tkinter or PyQt
Add Morse code decoding from audio input
Export Morse to audio files (WAV/MP3)
